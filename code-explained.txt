PART 1
**************************

1.
initialize a new instance of socket.io

const messenger = require('socket.io')();

2.
listen on the connection event for incoming sockets
and log it in to the console

when you make a connection to the meneger service
it creates socket whener anybody connects

messenger.on('connection', (socket) => {
	console.log(`a user connected: ${socket.id}`);

});


3. in main.js:

load the socket.io-client, which exposes
an io global (and the endpoint GET /socket.io/socket.io.js), and then connect.

when I call io(), фтв it defaults to trying to connect to the host that serves the page.

const socket = io();


4.
Each socket also fires a special disconnect event:

socket.on('disconnect', () => {
		console.log('a user has disconnected');
	})



5. 

when the user types in a message, the server gets it as a chat message event 

socket.emit('chatmessage', { content: this.message, name: this.nickname || "Anonymys" });

	socket.on('chatmessage', function (msg) {
		console.log(msg);
		messenger.emit('message', { id: socket.id, message: msg })
	});
